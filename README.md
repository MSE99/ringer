# Ringer

A simple CLI tool for monitoring the status of applications

## Why ?

While working at Aram Tech i built a tool called `pinger` which is an internal tool we also used to monitor the status of our APIs and other kind of services
it was pretty cool and powerful (we set it up to send SMS messages to the teams phones whenever a service went down.), i was looking into rust and thought it
would be a nice challenge to re-create the same tool but in Rust, right now this project is still under development and a lot of features are missing and not
all of the code, what i want to add next is:

- [ ] An exhaustive number of tests with at least 80% test coverage.
- [ ] A CLI setup command that allows the user to easily create configuration files.
- [ ] A simple CI/CD pipeline that builds an executable and publishes it.
